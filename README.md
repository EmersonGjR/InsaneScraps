# InsaneScraps
* A monitor for crash betting on insane.gg
Description:
  * This is a monitor that retrieves the values of the crash game from the website for betting on insane.gg.
  * The idea for this simple project came from my friend who enjoys betting on this website and requested this monitor from me. I personally do not bet and I do not encourage anybody to do so. If you want to earn more money, sit in your chair and study.
  * If you want more functionalities, you can submit a pull request or simply clone it to your own repository.
  
# How to use it
*  Ensure you have at least Java 21 and Maven installed.
*  You can either build and execute the project with Maven or directly execute the JAR file with Java:
   * To build and execute with Maven:
    mvn clean install
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.scraps.app.App

   * Alternatively, you can directly execute the JAR file with Java:
